- **README.md** - that is this file :)
- **index.html** - this is the HTML file that generates the webpage
- **static** - this folder houses the data and other code files that generate the map in the HTML file.
    - **css** - this folder holds the provided CSS and the one I added in from the Leaflet-Legend tool I found (https://github.com/ptma/Leaflet.Legend)
    - **js** - this folder holds the Javascript code I wrote as well as the one I added from the Leaflet-Legend tool I found (https://github.com/ptma/Leaflet.Legend)

## Initial Set Up and Issues

I was able to quickly create the map and the circles within the map. I originally wanted to include all earthquake data over the last 30 days, but realized quickly that the map would take longer to load than I prefered. I opted to scale down to all earthquakes within the last 7 days.

The issue I ran into was in creating the legend. I couldn't find an example within the notes that felt intuitive to create. Instead, I went searching for and found another Javascript library that allowed me to easily create the legend.
